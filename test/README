Compilator
----------

Every file found under the Compilator directory is compiled by GCC both with and
without the DragonEgg plugin, at a variety of optimization levels.  If GCC can
compile a file but DragonEgg cannot, or DragonEgg can compile the file but GCC
cannot, then that test is considered to have failed.

You should either checkout the GCC testsuite in the Compilator directory or use
a symbolic link to ensure that Compilator/gcc-testsuite means the gcc/testsuite/
directory from the GCC source tree.
