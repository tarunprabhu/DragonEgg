- Compilator -
--------------

Every file found under the Compilator directory is compiled by GCC both with and
without the DragonEgg plugin, at a variety of optimization levels.  If GCC can
compile a file but DragonEgg cannot, or DragonEgg can compile the file but GCC
cannot, then that test is considered to have failed.

External source
---------------

You should either checkout the GCC testsuite in the Compilator directory or use
a symbolic link to ensure that Compilator/gcc-testsuite means the gcc/testsuite/
directory from the GCC source tree.

For testing Fortran, consider putting a copy of the LAPACK source distribution
in the Compilator directory.  Note that LAPACK includes a copy of the BLAS.  A
few other interesting collections of Fortran source code:
  The NIST Fortran 77 test suite
  The polyhedron benchmarks

For testing Java, consider putting a link to GCC's libjava in the Compilator
directory.
